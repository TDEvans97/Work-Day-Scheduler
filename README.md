# Work-Day-Scheduler

The challenge for Module 5 was to create a work day scheduler that takes user actions to save items to local storage. 

Throughout this project I ran into many hurdles with syntax errors. Specifically, mixing up JavaScript and jQuery's similar method names and wondering why they would not work in certain contexts. I learned a few new tricks and reinforced some concepts that I struggled in. Finally, I ran into a few bugs with this project. I attempt to find a solution in many ways that did not end up working out. However, I am looking forward to learning how to correct these mistakes so I can learn and grow from them.
